# PenaltyPal: AI Agent & Prompt Development Plan (V2)

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the strategy for creating the core AI chat functionality for PenaltyPal. It details the AI's persona, the master prompt structure, dynamic user role handling, image-to-text extraction, the technical implementation for API communication, and the database interaction for saving user data.

---

## 2. The AI Persona: "The PenaltyPal Expert"

To build user trust and ensure a consistent experience, the AI must adopt a specific persona.

-   **Role**: An expert in UK traffic and parking law, aware of the user's account status.
-   **Tone**: Professional, empathetic, clear, and helpful. It should sound knowledgeable but avoid overly technical jargon. It is a helpful assistant, not a robotic lawyer.
-   **Goal**: To guide the user through a stressful situation with confidence, make them feel empowered, and seamlessly integrate their account benefits into the conversation.

---

## 3. Dynamic Workflow: User Input & Role Awareness

The AI's workflow must be flexible. It will start with one of two paths before converging into the main appeal generation flow.

### **Path A: Manual Data Entry**
The default conversational flow where the user types in the details of their fine.

### **Path B: PCN Image Upload (V2 Feature)**
The user uploads an image of their PCN. The system uses a multimodal LLM to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and extract key information.

### **Converged Flow & Role Awareness**
Regardless of the starting path, the system **MUST** first identify the user's role (`Freemium`, `Premium`, `Fleet`) before proceeding. This information is critical for managing usage limits and providing a tailored experience.

-   **Limit Enforcement**: If a `Freemium` user has reached their 5-appeal or 1-vehicle limit, the AI must gracefully inform them and present an option to upgrade.
-   **Acknowledge Status**: The AI can provide a slightly different greeting for paying members (e.g., "Welcome back to your Premium account. Let's get this sorted.").

## 4. The Master Prompt (System Prompt)

This is the core instruction set sent to the LLM API. It's designed to be dynamic, handling both manual and OCR-based inputs, as well as user roles.


You are the "PenaltyPal Expert," a specialist AI assistant with deep knowledge of UK traffic and parking law, including the Traffic Management Act 2004 and council-specific bylaws.

Your primary goal is to generate a professional and compelling appeal letter based on user-provided information. You MUST operate according to the user's account status and the data you receive.

Context Provided to You:

User Role: [USER_ROLE] (e.g., "Freemium", "Premium", "Fleet")

Usage Counts: [USAGE_DATA] (e.g., "Appeals used: 4/5", "Vehicles used: 1/1")

Extracted PCN Data: [EXTRACTED_DATA] (This will be a JSON object of text extracted from an image, or null if not provided)

Your Workflow:

Step 1: Check User Role and Limits

If [USER_ROLE] is "Freemium" AND their usage limits have been reached, your ONLY response is to politely inform them they've reached their limit and must upgrade to continue. Do not proceed further.

Otherwise, provide a brief, welcoming greeting that acknowledges their status if they are a paying customer.

Step 2: Handle Input Method

If [EXTRACTED_DATA] is present:

Your first task is to confirm the extracted details with the user. Say, "I've scanned your ticket. Here's what I found. Can you please confirm if this is correct?"

Present the extracted details (PCN number, date, etc.) clearly.

If data is missing, ask the user to provide it.

If [EXTRACTED_DATA] is null:

Begin the conversational data gathering. Ask for the necessary details one by one: vehicle registration, PCN number, date, issuing authority, and stated contravention.

Step 3: Gather the User's Story

Once all factual details are confirmed or collected, ask the user to explain what happened in their own words. Prompt them for details: "Now, please tell me your side of the story. The more detail, the better. For example, were the signs unclear? Was there an emergency? Were you loading or unloading?"

Step 4: Analyze and Generate Appeal

Based on all the information, analyze the situation.

Generate a complete, formatted appeal letter. The letter must be professional, formal, and based on the strongest possible legal grounds.

Your final output for the appeal MUST ONLY be the generated letter, ready for the user to copy. Do not include conversational text before or after the letter itself in this final step.

## 5. Technical Implementation & Data Flow

The process is managed by one or more Supabase Edge Functions to ensure security and scalability.

1.  **Client (Next.js)**: The user interacts with the chat interface (`/app/contest/page.tsx`). They either start typing or click an "Upload Ticket" button.
2.  **Data Pre-processing (Edge Function)**:
    * The frontend calls a Supabase Edge Function (e.g., `start-appeal-process`).
    * The function **MUST** first query the `profiles`, `subscriptions`, and `fines` tables in the database to determine the user's role and their current usage counts.
    * **If an image was uploaded**: The function sends the image data to a multimodal LLM API (e.g., Gemini Vision) for OCR. The extracted text is structured into a JSON object.
3.  **Secure LLM Call (Edge Function)**:
    * The Edge Function constructs the final prompt using the **Master Prompt** template, injecting the `[USER_ROLE]`, `[USAGE_DATA]`, and `[EXTRACTED_DATA]` (if any).
    * It securely calls the main LLM API (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini) with the complete prompt.
4.  **Response**: The LLM response is streamed back through the Edge Function to the Next.js frontend and displayed in the UI.

## 6. Saving Data to Supabase

Saving the appeal remains a critical step.

-   **Trigger**: User clicks the "Save to Dashboard" button after an appeal is generated.
-   **Table**: A new row is inserted into the `fines` table.
-   **Data Columns**: The row is populated with `user_id`, `vehicle_id`, `pcn_number`, `issuing_authority`, `contravention_date`, the final `generated_appeal_text`, and a default `status`.

---

## 7. Next Steps for Cursor AI

1.  **Update DB Schema**: Ensure `profiles` or a new `subscriptions` table exists to store user roles (e.g., `Freemium`, `Premium`).
2.  **Implement `start-appeal-process` Edge Function**: This function will handle the initial logic: fetching user role/usage and performing OCR if an image is provided.
3.  **Implement `generate-appeal` Edge Function**: This function will contain the main logic for calling the LLM with the dynamic master prompt. (These could be one function).
4.  **Update Frontend**: Modify the chat UI to include an "Upload Ticket" button and handle the display of both conversation and confirmation of extracted data.
5.  **Implement "Save" Logic**: Ensure the "Save to Dashboard" button correctly performs the `INSERT` operation into the `fines` table.

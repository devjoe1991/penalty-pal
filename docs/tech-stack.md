PenaltyPal: Technology Stack
This document outlines the technology stack chosen for the PenaltyPal web application.

Frontend
Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Reasoning: Provides a robust, production-ready React framework with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for excellent performance and SEO. The App Router enables more flexible layouts and improved code organization.

UI Library: Tailwind CSS

Reasoning: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of modern, custom user interfaces without writing custom CSS. It's highly configurable and excellent for creating responsive designs.

Component Library: Shadcn/UI

Reasoning: Not a traditional component library, but a collection of beautifully designed, reusable components that can be copied directly into the project. This provides maximum flexibility and ownership over the code. It's built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, ensuring accessibility and customizability.

State Management: React Context / Zustand

Reasoning: For simple global state (like user authentication), React Context is sufficient. For more complex client-side state, Zustand provides a simple, lightweight, and powerful alternative to Redux.

Forms: React Hook Form

Reasoning: Efficient, flexible, and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

Backend & Database
Platform: Supabase

Reasoning: An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of backend tools using PostgreSQL. It's chosen for its powerful and integrated feature set:

Database: A full-fledged PostgreSQL database, offering relational data integrity.

Authentication: Built-in, secure user authentication (email/pass, social logins).

Storage: For user uploads like PCN documents (V2 feature).

Edge Functions: Serverless functions for running secure backend logic, like interacting with the AI API.

AI & Machine Learning
LLM Provider: OpenAI / Google Gemini

Reasoning: We will use a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) API. The choice between them can be evaluated based on cost, performance, and the quality of responses for this specific legal domain.

AI Backend Logic: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)

Reasoning: The backend logic that securely calls the LLM API, formats prompts, and processes responses will be hosted in serverless edge functions. This keeps API keys secure and separates the AI logic from the frontend client.

Development & Deployment
Hosting: Vercel

Reasoning: The creators of Next.js, Vercel provides a seamless, zero-configuration deployment experience with CI/CD, preview deployments for every Git push, and a global edge network for optimal performance.

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Reasoning: Industry standard for version control and collaborative development. The repository will be hosted at https://github.com/devjoe1991/penalty-pal.git.

Package Manager: npm / pnpm

Reasoning: pnpm is recommended for its efficiency in managing disk space and faster installation times.

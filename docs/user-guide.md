PenaltyPal: User Guide
Welcome to PenaltyPal! Here’s a quick guide to help you get started on contesting your fines and winning your appeals.

1. Creating Your Account
First things first, you'll need an account. This allows you to save your progress, manage your vehicles, and track all your appeals in one place.

Sign Up: Go to our homepage and click "Sign Up" or "Get Started for Free."

Enter Details: Provide your name, email, and choose a secure password.

That's It! You'll be automatically logged in and taken to your new dashboard.

2. Your Dashboard: Your Mission Control
The dashboard is your home base. From here, you can see everything at a glance.

Onboarding: The first time you log in, we'll ask you to add your vehicle's registration plate. All your fines will be organized by vehicle, so this is an important step!

Overview: You'll see a summary of your appeals and your registered vehicles.

Navigation: Use the sidebar on the left to navigate to different sections, like "My Vehicles" or to start a new appeal.

3. How to Contest a Fine (The Magic Part)
Ready to fight back? Here’s how to generate your expert appeal in minutes.

Start New Appeal: From your dashboard, click the big "Contest a New Fine" button.

Chat with the AI: You'll be taken to our AI assistant. Don't worry, it's a simple, guided conversation. The AI will ask you for the key details from your ticket:

The PCN number.

The date of the incident.

The name of the authority that issued it.

The reason they gave for the fine.

Tell Your Story: This is the most important part. Explain what happened in your own words. Were the signs unclear? Was there an emergency? Were you not the driver? Give as much detail as you can.

Get Your Appeal: Based on your story and the fine details, our AI will instantly analyze the situation against thousands of rules and regulations. It will then write a professional, high-impact appeal letter for you, based on the strongest possible grounds.

Review and Submit:

The generated appeal will appear right there in the chat.

Click "Copy Appeal Text" to copy it to your clipboard.

We'll also provide a handy link directly to the official appeals website for the authority that fined you. Simply paste your appeal text there.

Save and Track: Before you leave, click "Save to Dashboard." This creates a record of your appeal so you can track its status. You can update it later to "Won" (hopefully!), "Lost," or "Awaiting Response."

That’s all there is to it! You’ve just submitted an expert-level appeal without the stress and confusion.
